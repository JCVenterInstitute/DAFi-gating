We developed a generalized end-to-end differentiable model - Cell Scoring Neural Network (CSNN), which takes the available sample-level training data to predict diagnosis of the testing samples and identify the diagnostic cells simultaneously. We performed experiments to assess the performance of CSNN using both B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The B-ALL dataset can be found on FlowRepository in LMD format, while the CLL dataset is converted to TXT during de-identifcation, which can be found here. For other requests, please contact Edgar E.
