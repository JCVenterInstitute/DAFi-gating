This program serves as one step in the cross-sample mapping pipeline. It maps FLOCK results from merged aligned data to the
original individual files.

This program reads in a FLOCK result file and two folders. One folder (after alignment) contains the aligned individual files
(Tab-delimited TXT files), and the other contains the original individual files (before alignment).
The program outputs in the before alignment folder a set of sub-folders, each contains FLOCK results for one original 
individual file. These result files can be copied to the visualization interface for generating dot plots and summary 
statistics.

The file names and number of files in both folders need to be exactly the same.

Another input to this program is the number of clusters in the FLOCK results from merged aligned data.

The algorithm procedure is:

Read the FLOCK result file into memory, and the header. The result file is for a concatenation of all aligned individual files.

Enter the folder containing the individual aligned files, reads the number of files
Initiate a loop for each file
Open the file, reads the first and the second rows
Extract the population_ID from the FLOCK result file by searching for the first and the second rows.

Enter the folder containing the individual unaligned files, use the population_ID to generate other result files (MFI, profile,
percentage etc.), output files of each file into a different folder.
